neurosymbolic transformer implementation:
Core Components

SymbolicAttention:

This is a modified attention mechanism that can incorporate logical relationships and structured knowledge.
It includes a "logical_mask" that can influence attention weights based on symbolic knowledge.


SymbolExtractor:

Takes neural representations and converts them to discrete symbolic representations.
This bridges the gap between the continuous space of neural networks and the discrete space of symbolic reasoning.


KnowledgeGraphEmbedding:

Embeds knowledge graph triples (subject, predicate, object) to provide structured knowledge to the model.
This helps the model incorporate existing symbolic knowledge into its reasoning.


LogicalConstraintLayer:

Applies logical constraints to neural representations.
Helps enforce logical consistency in the neural network's outputs.


SymbolicReasoningLayer:

A placeholder for an actual symbolic reasoning engine.
In a real implementation, this would use a logic programming system like Prolog, Answer Set Programming, or a custom rule-based system.



How It Works

Neural Processing:

Input text is processed through the modified transformer architecture.
Knowledge graph information can be integrated during processing.


Neural-to-Symbolic Conversion:

The neural outputs are converted to symbolic representations.
These are discrete and amenable to logical reasoning.


Symbolic Reasoning:

Logic rules are applied to the symbolic representations.
This can derive new knowledge that wasn't explicitly in the input.


Feedback Loop (not fully implemented in the toy model):

In a complete system, the results from symbolic reasoning could be fed back to the neural component.
This creates a cycle of neural processing → symbolic reasoning → neural processing.



Potential Applications
This toy implementation could be extended for:

Question Answering: Combining neural text understanding with logical reasoning over facts.
Planning: Using symbolic reasoning for generating plans with neural networks providing context.
Interpretable AI: Making model decisions more transparent by exposing the symbolic reasoning.
Fact Verification: Using knowledge graphs and logical reasoning to verify claims made in text.

To develop this into a full superintelligence system, you would need to significantly scale up the model, integrate it with a powerful symbolic reasoning engine, and design training procedures that effectively teach the model to reason in a structured way.

    # Extract symbolic representation
    symbols = outputs['symbols']
    
    # Apply symbolic reasoning
    inferred_symbols = symbolic_reasoner.reason(symbols)

    # 1. Convert inferred symbols back to neural representations
    # 2. Feed them back to the neural model for another pass
    # 3. Integrate the results with the original outputs
